Static site for Artistica Painting, a painting company based out of the Bay Area established in 2013.

Site is built with Astro based on the [Stone](https://astro.build/themes/details/stone/) theme and should be hosted on GitHub Pages.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of this Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Picture.png
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Card.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `src/assets/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command           | Action                                       |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm install`    | Installs dependencies                        |
| `pnpm dev`        | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`  |
| `pnpm build`      | Build your production site to `./dist/`      |
| `pnpm preview`    | Preview your build locally, before deploying |
| `pnpm check`      | Compiles typescript and runs `astro check`   |
| `pnpm astro ...`  | Run CLI commands like `astro add`            |
| `pnpm lint:check` | Run prettier lint checks locally             |

## Local development

In order to get things working locally, you may need to create the following file:

> .env
>
> ```bash
> export ENVIRONMENT_VAR='<env_var>'
> ```

Then, before doing `pnpm start` run:

```
source .env
```
